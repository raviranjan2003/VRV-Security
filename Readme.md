# Secure Authentication and Authorization System with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Description
This project implements a secure authentication system using JWT tokens for user management and authorization based on roles. The role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism ensures that users can only access resources they are authorized to, enhancing the overall security of the system.

### Key Features

* *Secure User Registration*: Users can create accounts securely, with password hashing for added protection.
* *Login and Logout*: Secure login and logout functionality using JWT tokens.
* *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)*: User access is determined by their assigned role, ensuring they only interact with authorized resources.
* *Admin, User, and Moderator Roles*: Three predefined roles with distinct permissions for added security and flexibility.

## Implementation Details

### System Design
The system utilizes a modular design, with separate components for authentication, authorization, and data storage. This allows for easy maintenance and updates, as well as improved scalability.

### Security Measures
* *Password Hashing*: Passwords are stored securely using the bcryptjs library.
* *JWT Tokens*: Secure JWT tokens are generated for each user session, ensuring that only authorized users can access resources.
* *RBAC*: The RBAC mechanism ensures that users can only access resources based on their assigned role.

### Technical Requirements

### Node.js
Version 14 or higher.

### Express.js
Version 4 or higher.

### MongoDB
Version 3 or higher.

### bcryptjs
For password hashing.

### jsonwebtoken
For JWT token management.
